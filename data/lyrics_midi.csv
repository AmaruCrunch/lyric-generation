elton john,candle in the wind,goodbye norma jean & though i never knew you at all & you had the grace to hold yourself & while those around you crawled & they crawled out of the woodwork & and they whispered into your brain & they set you on the treadmill & and they made you change your name & and it seems to me you lived your life & like a candle in the wind & never knowing who to cling to & when the rain set in & and i would liked to have known you & but i was just a kid & your candle burned out long before & your legend ever did & loneliness was tough & the toughest role you ever played & hollywood created a superstar & and pain was the price you paid & even when you died & oh the press still hounded you & all the papers had to say & was that marilyn was found in the nude & and it seems to me you lived your life & like a candle in the wind & never knowing who to cling to & when the rain set in & and i would liked to have known you & but i was just a kid & your candle burned out long before & your legend ever did & goodbye norma jean & though i never knew you at all & you had the grace to hold yourself & while those around you crawled & goodbye norma jean & from the young man in the twenty second row & who sees you as something as more than sexual & more than just our marilyn monroe & and it seems to me you lived your life & like a candle in the wind & never knowing who to cling to & when the rain set in & and i would liked to have known you & but i was just a kid & your candle burned out long before & your legend ever did & the candle burned out long before & your legend ever did &,48.57142857142857,77.71428571428571,29.142857142857142,78.0,244.87456870278177,"[0, 35, 73, 25, 29, 30, 53, 52]","[42, 42, 42, 42, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35, 35,

berlin,the metro,the metro & berlin & i'm alone & sitting with my empty glass & my four walls & follow me through my past & i was on a paris train & i emerged in london rain & and you were waiting there & swimming through apologies & i remember searching for the perfect words & i was hoping you might change your mind & i remember a soldier sleeping next to me & riding on the metro & you wore white & smiling as you took my hand & so removed & we spoke of wintertime in france & minutes passed with shallow words & years have passed and still the hurt & i can see you now & smiling as i pulled away & i remember the letter wrinkled in my hand & i'll love you always filled my eyes & i remember a night we walked along the seine & riding on the metro & i remember a feeling coming over me & the soldier turned then looked away & i remember hating you for loving me & riding on the metro &,39.45945945945946,70.8108108108108,50.27027027027027,54.0,160.0,"[50, 26, 63, 29]","[35, 35, 38, 35, 35,

round & just tell me why & this is a land of confusion. & this is the world we live in & and these are the hands we're given & use them and lets start trying & to make it a place worth living in. & ooh superman where are you now & when everything's gone wrong somehow & the men of steel the men of power & are losing control by the hour. & this is the time & this is the place & where we look for the future & and there's not much love to go round & tell me why this is a land of confusion. & this is the world we live in & and these are the hands we're given & use them and lets start trying & to make it a place worth living in. & i remember long ago & when the sun was shining & ooh and the stars were bright & all through the night & and the sound of your laughter & as i held you tight & so long ago & i wont be coming home tonight & my generation will put it right & were not just making promises & that we know well never keep. & too many men & there's too many people & making too many problems & and not much love to go round & just tell me why & this is a land of confusion. & now this is the world we live in & and these are the hands we're given & use them and lets start trying &

believe in a city of gold & that lies in the deep distance he cried & and wept. & and so we set out with the best and his horns & and his crazy description of home. & after many days journey we came to a peak & where the beast gazed abroad and cried out. & we followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw & a spire of gold - no a trick of the eye that's all & but the beast was gone and a voice was heard: & they've got no horns and they've got no tail & they don't even know of our existence & am i wrong to believe in a city of gold & that lies in the deep distance & hello friend welcome home. &,43.98148148148148,74.76851851851852,38.19444444444444,109.0,205.2076130158944,"[0, 0, 35, 103, 29, 30, 30, 17, 88, 88, 78, 83, 83, 79, 79]","[66, 61, 69, 66, 61, 69, 66, 61, 69, 66,

genesis,in too deep,all that time i was searching nowhere to run to it started me thinking & wondering what i could make of my life who'd be waiting & asking all kinds of questions to myself but never

love you but i just can't take this & you know i love you but i'm playing for keeps & although i need you i'm not gonna make this & you know i want to but i'm in too deep. & so listen listen to me & you must believe me & i can feel your eyes go through me & but i don't know why. & i know you're going but i can't believe it's the way that you're leaving & it's like we never knew each other at all it may be my fault & i gave you too many reasons being alone when i didn't want to & i thought you'd always be there i almost believed you & all this time i still remember everything you said & there's so much you promised how could i ever forget. & listen you know i love you but i just can't take this & you know i love you but i'm playing for keeps & although i need you i'm not gonna make this & you know i want to but i'm in too deep. & so listen listen to me & i can feel your eyes go through me & it seems i've spent too long & only thinking about myself & now i want to spend my life & just caring bout somebody else. & listen you know i love you but i just can't take this & you know i love you but i'm playing for keeps & although i need you i'm not gonna make this & you know i want

genesis,fifth of fifth,the path is clear & though no eyes can see & the course laid down long before. & and so with gods and men & the sheep remain inside their pen & though many times they've seen the way to leave. & he rides majestic & past homes of men & who care not or gaze with joy & to see reflected there & the trees the sky the lily fair & the scene of death is lying just below. & the mountain cuts off the town from view & like a cancer growth is removed by skill. & let it be revealed. & a waterfall his madrigal. & an inland sea his symphony. & undinal songs & urge the sailors on & till lured by sirens' cry. & now as the river dissolves in sea & so neptune has claimed another soul. & and so with gods and men & the sheep remain inside their pen & until the shepherd leads his flock away. & the sands of time were eroded by & the river of constant change. &,36.666666666666664,68.33333333333333,60.55555555555555,57.0,186.5105023963804,"[24, 35, 30, 16, 27, 0, 0, 73, 81, 81,

levee but the levee was dry & them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye & and singin' this'll be the day that i die & this'll be the day that i die & helter skelter in a summer swelter & the birds flew off with a fallout shelter & eight miles high and falling fast & it landed foul on the grass & the players tried for a forward pass & with the jester on the sidelines in a cast & now the half-time air was sweet perfume & while sergeants played a marching tune & we all got up to dance & oh but we never got the chance & 'cause the players tried to take the field & the marching band refused to yield & do you recall what was revealed & the day the music died? & we started singin' & bye bye miss american pie & drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry & them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye & and singin' this'll be the day that i die & this'll be the day that i die & oh and there we were all in one place & a generation lost in space & with no time left to start again & so come on jack be nimble jack be quick & jack flash sat on a candlestick & 'cause fire is the devil's only friend & oh and as i watched him on the stage & my hands were clenched in fists of rage & no angel born in hell & could break that satan's spell & and as the flames climbed high into the night & to light the sacrificial rite & i saw satan laughing with delight & the day the music died & he was singin' & bye bye miss american pie & drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry & them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye & singin' this'll be the day that i die & this'll be the day that i die & i met a girl who sang the blues & and i asked her for some happy news & but she just smiled and turned away & i went down to the sacred store & where i'd heard the music years before & but the man there said the music wouldn't play & and in the streets the children screamed & the lovers cried and the poets dreamed & but not a word was spoken & the church bells all were broken & and the three men i admire most & the father son and the holy ghost & they caught the last train for the coast & the day the music died & and they were singing & bye bye miss american pie & drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry & and them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye & singin' this'll be the day that i die & this'll be the day that i die & they were singing & bye bye miss american pie & drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry & them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye & singin' this'll be the day that i die

boyzone,i love the way you love me,i like the feel of your name on my lips & and i like the sound of your sweet gentle kiss & the way that your fingers run through my hair & and how your scent lingers even when you're not there & and i like the way your eyes dance when you laugh & and how you enjoy your two-hour bath & and how you've convinced me to dance in the rain & with everyone watching like we were insane & [chorus:] & but i love the way you love me & strong and wild slow and easy & heart and soul so completely & i love the way you love me & and i like the sound of old r 'n' b & and you roll your eyes when i'm slightly off key & and i like the innocent way that you cry & at sappy old movies you've seen thousands of times & [chorus] & (listen to me now) & and i could list a million things & i love to like about you & but they could all come down to one reason & i could never live without you & [chorus]

don henley,end of the innocence,remember when the days were long & and rolled beneath a deep blue sky & didn't have a care in the world & with mommy and daddy standing by & when happily ever after fails & and we've been poisoned by these fairy tales & the lawyers dwell on small details & since daddy had to fly & but i know a place where we can go & still untouched by man & we'll sit and watch the clouds roll by & and the tall grass wave in the wind & you can lay your head back on the ground & and let your hair fall all around me & offer up your best defense & but this is the end & this is the end of the innocence & o' beautiful for spacious skies & but now those skies are threatening & they're beating plowshares into swords & for this tired old man that we elected king & armchair warriors often fail & and we've been poisoned by these fairy tales & the lawyers clean up all details & since daddy had to lie & but i know a place where we can go & and wash away this sin & we'll sit and watch the clouds roll by & and the tall grass wave in the wind & just lay your head back on the ground & and let your hair spill all around me & offer up your best defense & but this is the end & this is the end of the innocence & who knows how long this will last & now we've come so far so fast & but somewhere back there in the dust & that same small town in each of us & i need to remember this & so baby give me just one kiss & and let me take a long last look & before we say good bye & just lay your head back on the ground & and let your hair fall all around me & offer up your best defense & but this is the end & this is the end of the innocence &,43.575418994413404,80.72625698324022,39.385474860335194,69.0,241.82962464182967,"[0, 35, 50, 65, 89]","[62, 43, 55, 67, 62, 67, 57,
